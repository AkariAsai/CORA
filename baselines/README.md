## Baselines
This repository contains the information about the baselines (query/answer translation and BM 25). All of the codes here are implemented by [Velocity (Xinyan) Yu](https://velocitycavalry.github.io/).

- [bm25](bm25): Codes to build a BM25-based lexical retriever for each target language. We use [pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini) for the implementation.
- [trans-test](trans-test): Codes for machine translation models used to translate input queries and answers.
